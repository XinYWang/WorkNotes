1. RTTI (Runtime Type Information)
  RTTI is a mechanism that exposes info about an objectâ€™s datatype during runtime, which can be available only when the class has at least one virtual function.
  It allows the type of an object to be determined when the program is executing.
    Base *base_ptr = new Derived;
    Derived *derived_ptr = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(base_ptr);

2. Reduce Compilation Times With extern template
  extern template class vector<MyClass>;
