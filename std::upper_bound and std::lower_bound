lower_bound returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the range [first,last) which has a value not less than ‘val’.
upper_bound returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the range [first,last) which has a value greater than ‘val’.

vector<int>::iterator lower, upper;
lower = lower_bound(v.begin(), v.end(), 6);
upper = upper_bound(v.begin(), v.end(), 6);

(upper - lower) could calculate the duplicated number of a value in an sorted array
