singleton pattern:
  It means that it is only possible to create one instance within the Vkms application and it is accessible by getting a
  reference to it using a static method.

Dependency injection: a design pattern used to eliminate direct dependencies to internal and external interfaces.
  Instead of a direct import of these interfaces, the module declares an interface which shall be implemented outside
  the module and injected to it during initialization.
