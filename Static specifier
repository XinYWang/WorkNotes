static specifier:
  1. Hide, from global to local
  2. static variables are stored on static storage area, not in stack, default init value is 0
  3. Static variables when used inside function are initialized only once, and then they hold the value and have a scope till the program lifetime
  4. Static member functions work for the class as whole rather than for a particular object of a class, cannot access ordinary data members and member functions, but only static data members and static member functions
  5. Static data members of class are those members which are shared by all the objects and are not initialied using constructor, because these are not dependent on object initialization
  6. Static data members of class must be initialized explicitly, always outside the class. If not initialized, Linker will give error.
